</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Due to its low insertion loss, high isolation, high linearity, wide bandwidth,
and near-zero dc power consumption, radio frequency micro-electromechanical
(RF-MEMS) switches have been an emerging technology with significant potential
in many high frequency circuits and systems, especially those requiring
reconfiguration. In this talk, we present several RF-MEMS switch designs that
can significantly extend the hot-switching life-time of RF-MEMS contact
switches. To prevent the contact degradation during hot-switching events,
series and/or protection contacts are added in parallel with the &quot;real&quot;
contacts. For unpackaged devices using Au-Au as the &quot;real&quot; contact material and
Pt-Au as the protection contact material, we have demonstrated unprecedented
hot-switching performance of 150-million actuation cycles at 1-W  and
50-million at 2 W.</p>
